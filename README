Thank you for downloading Containers, a plugin for the 960 Grid System.
Containers adds some extra classes to the system to help with nesting grid
units -- specifically in instances where the developer is unable to add the
"alpha" and "omega" classes. The addition of a class called "container" to the
parent class helps make grid units fit. For more information, please see:



Containers comes in two flavors: default and IE6-compatible. To use, include
the appropriate CSS file in the <head> of the page, *after* the link for
960.css. Alternatively, you may copy and paste the code at the end of the
960.css file.

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/text.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/960.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/containers.css" />
</head>
